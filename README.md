# Informedica.Observations.Lib

This library aims to support the transition of serial patient signals (i.e. data points for a patient) 
to a data set with observations over time for a patient. This data set in turn can be used for further 
statistical and machine learning purposes.

The theory of this library is described in this [blog](https://informedica.nl/?p=213).
